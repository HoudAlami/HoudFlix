    description: "I joined O'Clock in July 2023 and i learned to become a web developer in it. During this intensive learning, i learned HTML and CSS for the basics and then Javascript. For the back-end, i saw NodeJs and PostgreSQL for the database. I chose to learn React and specialize my skills in React. I graduated in March."
